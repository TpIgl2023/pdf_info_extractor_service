When used within development tools, these systems typically treat each model invocation independently from all previous invocations, and only a specific limited functionality is exposed within the user interface. This approach to user interaction misses an opportunity for users to more deeply engage with the model by having the context of their previous interactions, as well as the context of their code, inform the model's responses. We developed a prototype system -the Programmer's Assistant -in order to explore the utility of conversational interactions grounded in code, as well as software engineers' receptiveness to the idea of conversing with, rather than invoking, a code-fluent LLM. Through an evaluation with 42 participants with varied levels of programming experience, we found that our system was capable of conducting extended, multi-turn discussions, and that it enabled additional knowledge and capabilities beyond code generation to emerge from the LLM. Despite skeptical initial expectations for conversational programming assistance, participants were impressed by the breadth of the assistant's capabilities, the quality of its responses, and its potential for improving their productivity. Our work demonstrates the unique potential of conversational interactions with LLMs for co-creative processes like software development."

It used a hybrid reasoning system capable of special-purpose reasoning based on frames and a plan calculus, along with general purpose logical reasoning.

Nonetheless, Weisz et al.  found that software engineers are still interested in using such models in their work, and that the imperfect outputs of these models can even help them produce higher-quality code via human-AI collaboration . New tools based on code-fluent LLMs are actively being developed. GitHub Copilot is described as \"Your AI pair programmer. \" It is optimized for the code autocompletion use case: given a starting snippet such as a method's documentation, signature, or partial implementation, Copilot completes the implementation. Copilot is based on the OpenAI Codex model , a 12 billion parameter version of GPT-3 , fine-tuned on code samples from 54 million public software repositories on GitHub. Empirical evaluations of this model have shown that, although the quality of its outputs is quite good, those outputs may still be problematic . Echoing the results from Weisz et al. , human-centered evaluations of Copilot have found that it increases users' feelings of productivity , and that almost a third (27%) of its proposed code completions were accepted by users. In a contrasting evaluation, Vaithilingam et al.  found that while most participants expressed a preference to use Copilot in their daily work, it did not necessarily improve their task completion times or success rates. Yet, in a study by , developers working with Copilot were able to implement a web server in Javascript 55% faster than developers who did not use Copilot."

Autocompletion was effective when developers were operating in \"acceleration mode\" and relied on the model to produce short completions that could be verified quickly. In \"exploration mode,\" however, the interaction was more awkward. Developers would communicate with Copilot by typing comments and seeing what Copilot generated in response. Then, they would modify their comments to explore other ways of prompting a response. Ultimately, the comments used to prompt the model would be deleted after the relevant code was generated, indicating that their value was largely in driving a back-and-forth, yet context free, dialog with the model to coerce it to produce the desired results through an iterative refinement process.

Initially, four authors performed open-coding on the open-ended survey responses. Through discussion, these codes were grouped and consolidated into a single set, which were then re-applied to the data by two authors. After another round of discussion, these authors identified a set of 12 higher-level themes. Some themes had clear parallels to quantitative survey questions or event log data, and thus represented clear instances where we were able to triangulate across data sources. Other themes surprised us. We structure our presentation of the results based on these 12 themes, grouped into three different aspects of the user experience: expectations and experience, utility of conversational assistance, and patterns of interaction and mental models."

Other NCF categories were split to provide nuanced detail about the interaction; for example, we distinguished three different kinds of NCF requests, depending upon whether they were stated as Requests for Action (e.g. codes to identify meta-information such as utterances that included code, utterances that referenced selected code, utterances that implicitly or explicitly referenced earlier portions of the conversation, or non-verbal UI activities such as copies, pastes, and invocations of \"try again\" and \"start over. \" Finally, we classified a subset of the human-applied codes based on whether they represented a participant's task or social orientation toward the assistant. We list our codes in Table , but note that not all of them ended up being relevant to our analysis. When coding conversational data, we applied individual codes at the level of each conversational utterance.

One of the challenges in interpreting participants' comments about the utility of the Programmer's Assistant was in disentangling the extent to which value was derived from the quality of the underlying model versus the integration of conversation in a code context. Indeed, participants felt that the chat interaction was valuable: 69.0% of participants felt that eliminating the conversational interaction and making the assistant behave more like web search would decrease its value. Further, our analysis of the conversation transcripts revealed that 42% of the 910 task-oriented utterances from participants required historical conversational context (Chat Context Required) in order to be correctly interpreted. Thus, we observe that behaviorally, participants did rely on conversational context in their interactions.",
                        "In the post-task survey, 83% of participants rated the importance of the ability to ask follow-up questions as being \"somewhat\" or \"a great deal. \" Several participants specifically commented on the value of this conversational context. P39 remarked, \"I absolutely loved how you can straight up ask follow-up questions to the Programmers' Assistant without having to reiterate the original topic/question. \" P15 expressed a similar sentiment, saying, \"I think the conversational context was someone helpful, just in communicating that it's a running conversation where my context is remembered. \" P9 provided a similar analysis:",
                        "\"This tool was so helpful at answering questions I had about the code in the context of the code I am working on... I was also impressed with how well it was able to remember the context of our conversation, especially when I asked vague follow-up questions. \" (P9)",
                        "In addition, some participants identified how a conversational interaction grounded in code was useful, \"because I think to 'understand' the dev context could be VERY important\" (P31). In fact, 24.9% of task-oriented utterances included a relevant code selection (Includes Selection), showing that participants valued this ability.",
                        "Contrasting with these participants, P18 felt that interacting with the assistant conversationally was tedious, and they employed a more direct approach: \"I really like the PA. But, I didn't converse with it like a chat bot. I often told it what to do ('Document this code.') as opposed to asking it what to do ('How do I document this code?'). Talking to it the way that was suggested in the tutorial seemed overly verbose/tedious. \" (P18) Despite these individual differences in interaction preferences, P39 envisioned that both interaction styles could be supported in the tool:",
                        "\"I think both options should exist: people should be able to input their queries like a search bar AND also give their question as if in conversation. \" (P39) 5.3.3 Learning Effects. One specific benefit of the Programmer's Assistant identified by participants is its ability to help people improve their programming skills and reinforce knowledge gaps. For example, it can help users \"remember how to do things in certain languages... such as, when I am using a language I haven't used in a while\" (P9). The assistant can also serve as an memory aid, such as when \"I use a lot of libraries that I don't always remember all of the functions\" (P15). Similarly, P31 said, \"No matter how good you're as a developer, you can't (humanly) remember all the API of hundreds of libs or new languages... I'd learn new dev lang and new lib/frameworks faster. \"",
                        "P39 felt the assistant \"is perfect for programmers of all levels, \" and P1 felt it could help them rapidly improve their Python skills: \"I have wanted to learn python... The main concern how much time spent learning is needed before I could actually get some value out of learning python. I have a feeling this would cut that time down from weeks to a day or so. \" (P1) P39 also identified the fact that, because the interactions with the assistant are conversational, it forces people to learn how to communicate to others about their code: \"The conversation aspect promotes proper communication, which would really stand to benefit budding programmers if they want to learn how to explain concepts more fluently in the future to their colleagues.\" (P39) Conversely, P36 suggested that over-reliance on programming assistance might have a detrimental effect to one's learning: \"It's definitely a huge time saver, but over-reliance on it may cause new developers to skip learning the reference material themselves and discovering new things and sparking new ideas. \" (P36) 5.3.4 Trust. Many participants raised questions about whether they could trust the responses provided by the Programmer's Assistant. P21 asked this question most directly: \"will the code be correct, safe, efficient?\" Other participants raised similar questions, such as, \"I'm wondering how it validates it's answers, if it can be trusted to always give a working answer\" (P10), and \"Sometimes lack of source and context may raise doubts in the mind of the programmer\" (P16).",
                        "These issues of trust were exacerbated by the fact that the Programmer's Assistant did not allow participants to actually run their code. Because of this limitation, participants had to rely on their own knowledge to judge the correctness of the assistant's responses. P19 asserted, \"There is no way to evaluate if the Programmer's assistant is giving you the right advise or not other than your own knowledge, \" and P9 concurred: \"I had to trust that it was correct (and use my own prior knowledge). \"",

                        "\"The only thing that made me nervous was that it could have introduced a bug that wasn't immediately apparent. And given I didn't write the code, I could have easily glossed over a mistake when reviewing it. Especially if it is also the one writing the test cases. \" (P18)",
                        "Despite our efforts to make the Programmer's Assistant respond in non-authoritative ways, we did observe participants sometimes uncritically accept generated results that were clearly wrong or incomplete. Thus, we did find behavioral evidence for over-reliance.",
                        "Listing 2: Building trust through explanations and justifications One way to address trust issues is for the assistant to provide further explanations and justifications that can calibrate a user's confidence in the assistant's responses. Such explanations could be requested conversationally, though most participants did not attempt to do so. One participant (P9) did ask for such explanations, and we show a summary of their transcript in Listing 2. In this instance, P9 asked for a definition of a unit test (line 1), an explanation of the code being tested (line 25), and justifications of the quality of the unit test (lines 31& 37).

More experienced participants made detailed requests about specific Python libraries or algorithms, such as, \"given a pandas dataframe with two columns 'Date' and 'Sales' please use matplotlib to draw me a scatterplot\" (P38, 3+ years of experience) and \"implement a rungekutta algorithm for solving an ODE with adaptive time steps\" (P37, 3+ years of experience).",

P15 described how the copy/paste boundary provided them with \"a bit more control to ask specific questions about what I wanted and to assess before putting it in my code.\" Other participants felt that the copy/paste boundary was more inefficient: \"I think the main difference is the ability of Copilot to suggest code while you type, what make it faster and easier to use. While using the Programmer's Assistant, you need to go to the chat, ask the question, copy the code (or rephrase the question if it was not understood by the agent), and edit it to match your code. \" (P3) A large number of participants felt that the conversational interaction was faster than web search (P1, P6, P7, P10, P11, P12, P16, P17, P18, P20, P24, P29, P30, P33, P36, P37, P42) because of its ability to provide \"real-time responses\" (P32) that can be \"applied exactly to your code\" (P33) without having to \"parse through lots of text... to get what you need\" (P15). In addition, the assistant provided \"MUCH faster, better responses\" (P17) that were \"much more relevant to the problems\" (P34) and \"simple  succinct\" (P9), without having to \"sort through answers on your own or read documentation\" (P9) or \"look at many posts before finding the relevant one\" (P18)."

Clearly, the Programmer's Assistant was viewed by our participants as a useful tool that provided real value -so much so that many participants explicitly requested or expressed the desire to use it in their own work.

Indeed, many participants commented on their surprise and satisfaction with the quality of the assistant's responses (Section 5.2.3). However, participants also valued the conversational interactions that they had with the assistant. In the event logs, we saw evidence that participants were leveraging conversational context to ask follow-up questions as well as leveraging code context by asking about their code selections (Section 5.3.2). Many participants reported that they would find the tool less valuable if the conversational interaction were removed (Section 5.3.2). Further, conversation seemed to provide unique value beyond other interaction models (direct manipulation and search) because of its embeddedness in the UI and its ability to surface emergent behaviors of the model (Section 5.4.4).",

For use cases in which a model is known to produce high-quality results (e.g. code autocompletion for Codex), a direct manipulation interface seems wholly appropriate as it would provide a discoverable and predictable way of invoking the model to produce a known type of result. However, direct manipulation interfaces may be less ideal for surfacing the emergent behaviors of a foundation model , and thus natural language interaction may be more suitable. Many popular text-to-image models, such as DALL-E 2  and Stable Diffusion , operate in a one-shot fashion, in which the user specifies a prompt, clicks a button, and gets results. Our study demonstrates how the additional contextual layers of conversational history and the artifact-under-development provide additional value to the co-creative process."

They found mixed results, with no clear consensus emerging on how to design human-centered AI systems that can guarantee positive synergy. Summarizing from their discussion, \"Perhaps achieving substantial synergies among people and computers is harder than many people think. Perhaps it requires... new ways of configuring groups that include people and computers. And perhaps it needs more systematic, focused attention from researchers than it has, so far, received. \"  We believe such evaluations of human-AI synergy should go beyond one-shot performance measures. As implied by many of the uses cases listed by Seeber et al. , human-centered AI systems are often deployed in socio-organizational contexts that require longitudinal use , such as product design , game design , and engineering . Thus, we would expect that over time and through interaction with each other, human-AI teams would improve their performance through a mutual learning process."

We assert that the learning should operate in both directions: not only should people improve their programming skills, but the model itself can also improve based on peoples' interactions with it. For example, when the assistant provides a code example to the user, and the user takes that example and edits it, those edits constitute feedback that can be used to further fine-tune the model. In addition, through longitudinal use, we believe that human and AI partners can create reciprocal representations of one another -i.e., the human is likely to create a mental model of the AI, and the AI may be engineered to develop a user model for each of its human users . Such a pair of models is often described as Mutual Theory of Mind . This type of capability raises the possibility of personalizing and adapting an assistant to the strengths and needs of individual users."

How can we help users to regain their prior context after dealing with an interruption (e.g. )? Should an assistant be used to persuade or nudge the user (e.g. )? Who should determine the topic, frequency, and insistence of such persuasion attempts (e.g. )? Should users have the ability to moderate or defeat attempted persuasions, or should those decisions be left to the organization?"

We posit that peoples' effectiveness in working with an AI system may be influenced by their role orientation, and we encourage future research in this area."

The assistant was implemented using a stateof-the-art code-fluent large language model, Codex , and was capable of generating both code and natural language responses to user inquiries. We further used the prompting mechanism of the model to set up a conversational interaction in which the model uses the conversational history, plus the user's current utterance, in order to generate a response. In this way, users are able to ask follow-up questions in the chat that reference prior utterances and responses. We incorporated the conversational assistant into a code editing environment, enabling the conversation to be grounded in the context of the user's source code."

Many participants noted the high quality of the conversational responses, including the assistant's ability to produce code, explain code, answer general programming questions, and even answer general knowledge questions.

Each modality was shown to have advantages and disadvantages. For example, text-only interfaces can provide accessibility and productivity advantages, whereas graphical user interfaces provide greater discoverability. Some researchers explored ways to bridge the two interaction modes, such as by developing GUI wrappers for command line programs or by developing tools that converted GUI activities into procedural descriptions. Our view is that similar bridges can be constructed between direct manipulation, search, and conversational models of interaction; a user's interaction with an LLM need not be constrained to a single interaction model."
